// This file is part of the Genkit restoration process.
// In Genkit v1.x, the development server/panel is typically run via CLI `genkit start`.
// If a specific Next.js integration for the dev panel (like `genkit/next` devProxy for v0.x)
// is desired and available for v1.x, it would be configured differently.
// For now, this file is kept as an empty module to prevent build errors if it's imported elsewhere.
